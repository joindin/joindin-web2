## What to work on

You should work on what you want to. Our bug tracker is
here: https://github.com/joindin/joindin-web2/issues

Any issues that have the "hackathon" or "easypick" label are ones that we think
are a good starting point. This [filter](https://github.com/joindin/joindin-web2/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aeasy-pick) will give you the list of all
current "easy-pick" issues.

If you have any problems, ask on the IRC channel or send an email to
the mailing list.

## Issue tracker management

If you start working on an issue, please assign yourself to it and mark the issue as "in progress".

## Code Style

All PHP code follows [psr-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/).
