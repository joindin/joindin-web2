How to compile SASS
==

See https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/2016.3/transpiling-sass-less-and-scss-to-css.html for instructions on how to compile SASS to CSS in phpstorm

To compile the SASS into a CSS file using Grunt, run the following command:
```
grunt sass
```

These files are then compiled into `web/css/main.css` and `web/css/main.css.map`
**Please do not edit these files directly, as the SASS compiler will overwrite any changes**
