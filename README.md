# Joind.in

This is the source code for the next generation of the Joind.in website - a resource set up to allow
events to get real-time feedback from those attending. It also gives speakers a 
way to claim and track their presentations over time.

This version is the next generation version, providing a responsive cross-device site for screens of all devices

You can install joind.in on an existing PHP platform

## Quick Start

1. Create a vhost entry for the site. The docroot should be `/web`.

        ServerName joindin.local

        DocumentRoot "/home/exampleuser/www/joind.in/web"

        <Directory "/home/exampleuser/www/joind.in">
            Options FollowSymLinks
            AllowOverride All
        </Directory>
    </VirtualHost>

2. Add hostname to /etc/hosts.

   echo "127.0.0.1 joindin.local" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
