    <h1 class="title">About Joind.in</h1>

    <p>Joind.in brings attendee feedback to speakers at events, quickly and transparently.  Getting feedback lets speakers improve, attendees be heard, and organisers find out what really works (and doesn't!) at their events.  All this means ... better events and speakers!</p>

    <p>Some highlights of using joind.in with your event:
    <ul><li>Let us know your CfP dates and we'll help spread the word.  Other organisations use our data feed and we also run <a target="_blank" href="http://callingallpapers.com">http://callingallpapers.com</a></li>
    <li>Schedule view: with your talks entered, people can use joind.in to view the schedule by track or in agenda layout</li>
    <li>Speakers get great feedback and improve every year - having this feature means a lot to them</li></ul>

    <h2>Event Organisers</h2>

    <p>If you want to use joind.in to get feedback to your speakers, then you're welcome to do so! Head over to <a href="{{ urlFor('events-index') }}">the events page</a> and submit your event details.  These are approved by a human (usually within a couple of days) and we'll email you when your event is ready for you to edit.</p>

    <h2>Speakers</h2>

    <p>Claim your talks!  When you're listed as giving a talk, this will be attached to your account when you claim it and the event organiser has approved your claim.  Once claimed, you can edit your talk record to add links to slides and reply to comments by attendees</p>

    <h2>Open Source</h2>

    <p>Joind.in is built and run by volunteers, and is an open source project.  If you want to get involved, we'd be delighted to have you, regardless of who you are or your level of experience - lots of people make their first contributions to open source on this project and we try hard to make it easy to get started with.</p>
