            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt>English</dt>
                <dd>
                    Please ensure that the description is in English with a translation below if appropriate.
                </dd>
            </dl>
            <dl>
                <dt>Map</dt>
                <dd>
                    Add the venue location to get a map on the website and apps so people can find you on the day.
                </dd>
            </dl>
            <dl>
                <dt>Call for Papers</dt>
                <dd>
                    If your event has a call for papers, add a link to it and the dates when it will be open.
                </dd>
            </dl>
